# Asyncio Template

This is skeleton code for some asyncio tools I have written. The purpose of this template is to allow for quickly writing PoCs to leverage asynchronous handling via Python's asyncio library. In order to modify the template to work how you want, follow the comments throughout the code:

```
# Asyncio Template Commenting:
#   TODO:      Instructions for modifications or updates per tooling.
#   EXAMPLE:   Examples of code blocks that can be leveraged.
#   NOTE:      Details of specific code blocks that can/should be modified
#              per reorganization of code.
```

## Tool Structure

```
main.py       # This is where the main functionality occurs
|
|__ modules/  # This is where the task modules live
|
|__ core/     # This is where the support and config functions live
```
